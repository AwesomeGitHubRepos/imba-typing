# Imba typing

Typing speed test made with Imba (and Sass). This is my first project using Imba. You can check it [here](https://github.com/somebee/imba). It's super simple and have a short learning curve, I encourage you to try it.

# Installation

```
npm install
```

# Run and Development

## Using webpack-dev Server

```
npm run dev
```

Then open `localhost:8080`

## Using standalone

```
npm install -g imba
imbapack --watch src/client.imba
```

It will output `dist/client.js`, then just open `dist/index.html` directly on a browser
